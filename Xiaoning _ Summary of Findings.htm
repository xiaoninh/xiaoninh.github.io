					<h3>User Interviews</h3>
					<br><br>
					<p>Before building my portfolio, in order to gather insights about what people expect to see on a personal portfolio website, I conducted 4 user interviews. The interviewees are peer students at UCI, some of them are in related technology fields some of them are not. The information provided by the interviewees provide insites about what features and functions I should include in my portfolio.</p>

					<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>

					<p>To identify usability issues of the current version portfolio, I did cognitive walkthrough with 3 individual users by asking to complete a series of tasks on my interface.  By asking user questions along the walkthrough and observe their actions, I obtained feedbacks about the current interface and identified several important weaknesses, such as the choice of background color, plain design, and lack of details, etc,.</p>

					<p>I conducted two user testings by using the tools provided by usability hub. The first test was a click test asking user where would they click if they want to know the previous work, the second test was a preference test comparing two version of page design and asking user to choose the one they think is better. Both test have yield useful results and revealed usability problems that I never have thought before.  </p>

					<p>By conducting a series of cognitive walkthrough and user tastings, I have identified several usability issues of my portfolio.  The first issue identified was the pink background color of the page. While myself love pink very much, I did not even hesitate to use nothing else but all pink as my background. However, 2 of my walkthrough users reflected that the pink color was too solid on the background and made the portfolio seem less professional. This problem was also reflected by the second user test when comparing two designs of the page. 13 out of 25 users chose the second page because the first page is full of pink and the second one has it with white.  <br><br>
					The second issue found was that the portfolio lack of details and picture demonstrations of certain projects and research. Most users from the cognitive walkthrough said that the descriptions of projects were too brief right now which does not allow them to understand 
					the projects thoroughly, and they wanted to have someplace to click on to have a close look at the project. <br><br>
					The other issue identified was the overall plain design of the portfolio. The only visual elements of the portfolio are the profile picture, and the pink background which has been complained by many. All the other contents are demonstrated poorly in bullet points on the page. Most users from both the walkthrough and testing suggest adding more pictures or other visual design to the portfolio, in order to demonstrate the artistic aspect of a UX designer.

				<div class="col">
					<p>In order to address the usability issues mentioned above and to improve the overall design and user experience, rather than making changes on the current version, I built a totally new portfolio page on anther GitHub repository. I started with sketching to re-design the lay out and contents of my portfolio. In my new portfolio, these followings points are the major changes I have make to incorporate the findings:<br><br><ul>
					<li> I used a combination of pink and white as my background color instead of using all pink to make the website look more soft and official. </li><br>
					<li> I moved most of the “about me” contents into a separate "about me" page and only left simple information on the top of home page. </li><br>
				    <li> Instead of listing everything with bullet points, I organized the projects into different sections, separated with white spacing. </li><br>
				   <li>  There is a “more” button added to each project on the home page, which allow users to click on and to check out more detail information about each project. </li><br>
				    <li> Finally, In order to make the new portfolio site more visual, I also added pictures to each of the project, and I draw my own button to navigate to the about me page. </li> <br>
